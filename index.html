            <h2>Rules of Play and Policies</h2>
            <p id="FIFA">FIFA rules shall govern NYSL play except as modified herein.</p>
            <h3>SPORTSMANSHIP</h3>
            <ul>
                <li class="no-numbers">The common interest that members of the Association share is to inspire
                    youth to practice the ideals of sportsmanship and fair play. Any player,
                    coach, team, parent, spectator, administrator or referee whose behavior
                    detracts from this purpose is subject to disciplinary action regardless of
                    technical soccer background, expertise, accomplishments or standing.</li>
            </ul>

            <h3>FIFA FIELD REGULATIONS</h3>
            <ol type="1">
                <li><strong>DIMENSIONS.</strong> FIFA Law 1 provides for flexible external field dimensions
                    within a given maximum and minimum width and length. These
                    dimensions should be adhered to for all fields used by teams under 12
                    and older.</li>
                <li><strong>COMPETITION FIELDS.</strong> Fields used within the competition program must
                    be a minimum of 100 x 60 yards. Leagues, districts or associations
                    participating in the state competition program that are unable to provide a
                    field that meets these minimum requirements must advise the State
                    Competition Board which will assign its Fields Committee to inspect the
                    field and recommend to the Board whether or not a waiver of the minimum
                    dimensions should be granted. Teams from leagues, districts or
                    associations that are unable to provide an acceptable field may be
                    required to play all their games away.</li>
                <li><strong>FIELDS USED BY YOUNG AGE GROUPS.</strong>
                    <ol type="a">
                        <li>U-6 play on a field approximately 20 X 40 yards with no penalty
                            areas. Fields for older age groups should be progressively larger.</li>
                        <li>U-8 plays on a field 40-50 yards in length and 20-30 yards width.</li>
                        <li>U-10 play on a field 70-80 yards in length and 40-50 yards in width.</li>
                        <li>In addition, fields used by young age groups may have their internal
                            dimensions and size of goal similarly modified.</li>
                    </ol>
                </li>
                <li><strong>TEAM BENCH AREAS</strong>
                    <ol type="a">
                        <li>Recreation & District Programs
                            <ul>
                                <li>The decision for team/spectator placement on the field will
                                    be made by the governing body of that team. A team’s
                                    bench area shall consist of that area at least one (1) yard
                                    away from the touchline and extending to twenty yards (20)
                                    both ways from the halfway line. In the event that field
                                    2
                                    conditions require team benches to be on the same side of
                                    the field, a team’s bench area shall consist of that area two
                                    (2) yards away from the touchline and extending twenty
                                    yards one (1) way from the halfway line.</li>
                                <li>The home team has first choice as to where it wishes to
                                    locate its bench area. Coaches and substitutes are required
                                    to remain within their bench area during the game. Parents
                                    and spectators should occupy the same side of the field as
                                    the team they are supporting.</li>
                            </ul>
                        </li>
                        <li>State Competition League Only
                            <ul>
                                <li>Except where it is determined by the referee to be
                                    impractical, team bench areas shall be along the same
                                    touchline. Each team bench area shall be located two yards
                                    outside the touchline, beginning not closer than five yards
                                    from midfield and extending not further than twenty yards
                                    from midfield. The home team shall have the right to choose
                                    the location of its bench area. Coaches and substitutes must
                                    remain within their team's bench area during the game.</li>
                                <li>Parents and spectators must occupy the sideline opposite
                                    the team bench areas. Supporters of a team must assemble
                                    on the side of the midfield facing the team bench area of that
                                    team. There shall be a buffer zone extending ten yards on
                                    each side of the midfield that may not be occupied by
                                    parents or spectators. Match officials shall be empowered to
                                    enforce these provisions and may suspend or terminate
                                    games in the event that any team, coach, parent, or
                                    spectator declines to abide by requests from match officials
                                    to comply with these standards.</li>
                            </ul>
                        </li>
                    </ol>
                </li>
            </ol>
            <h3>EQUIPMENT</h3>
            <ul>
                <li>We will abide by and accept equipment standards as defined by FIFA,
                    USSF and USYSA.</li>
            </ul>
            <h3>NUMBER OF PLAYERS</h3>
            <ul>
                <li><strong>TEAM SIZE.</strong>strong> Except as noted below, team rosters shall consist of not less
                    than eleven nor more than eighteen players. A team must have at least
                    seven (7) players present and able to play before referees are permitted to
                    start a sanctioned game. No more than eleven (11) players per team may
                    be on the field at any one time during the game.</li>
                <li><strong>SIZE OF AGE GROUP TEAMS.</strong> In order to give player’s maximum
                    opportunity to develop in the game of soccer, U-6 through U-1O play
                    modified rules and size of roster as stated in United States Youth Soccer
                    Association (USYSA) rules. It is strongly recommended that U-6 and U-8
                    play 4 v 4. UYSA shall not sanction games involving teams under 10 or
                    younger unless such games are conducted with not more than eight (8)
                    players per side. (National rule 4036 section 2)</li>
                <li>Recreational/Developmental players at other ages or where numbers in
                    the playing area are low are strongly encouraged to play small-sided
                    games on reduced field size.</li>
            </ul>
            <h3>SUBSTITUTIONS</h3>
            <ul>
                <li>Teams may make an unlimited number of substitutions at the times
                    indicated below. A player who has been replaced may re-enter the game
                    as a substitute at a later time.
                    <ol type="1">
                        <li>Prior to a throw-in your favor.</li>
                        <li>Prior to a goalkick by either team.</li>
                        <li>After a goal by either team.</li>
                        <li>After an injury, by either team, when the referee stops play.</li>
                        <li>At half time.</li>
                        <li>When a player has been “cautioned”, only the player receiving
                            “caution” may be substituted.</li>
                    </ol>
                </li>
            </ul>
            <h3>CONFISCATED PLAYER PASSES</h3>
            <ul>
                <li>Passes of any individual(s) ejected from any match shall be retained after
                    the match by the referee. The pass of any individual who has received a
                    third caution (yellow card) during a playing year shall be confiscated by
                    the referee at the conclusion of the match in which the third caution was
                    received. That player will be suspended from playing in the next game in
                    which the offending participant would otherwise be eligible to participate.
                    This process will continue so that for every third yellow card received
                    during a playing year, the player will be suspended from playing in the
                    next game (after the receipt of a third yellow card) for which the offending
                    participate would otherwise be eligible to participate. The referee shall
                    deliver all confiscated passes to the UYSA State Office within forty-eight
                    (48) hours of the conclusion of the match.</li>
            </ul>
            <h3>ALL-PLAY</h3>
            <ul>
                <li>All-play means that every recreation player on every team shall play at
                    least fifty percent of each game. Coaches in the competition program are
                    encouraged to play their players 50% of each game.
                    <ul class="circle">
                        <li>A Coach shall be permitted to not play a player 50% of each game
                            under special circumstances, e.g., unexcused absences from
                            practice and/or games, ungentlemanly conduct at practice and/or
                            games, and injuries.</li>
                    </ul>
                </li>
            </ul>
            <h3>PLAYERS’ EQUIPMENT</h3>
            <ul>
                <li>Where the uniform colors of both teams are so similar that the referee
                    orders a change, the designated home team must change to colors
                    distinct from those of the opponent.</li>
            </ul>
            <h3>MIXED TEAMS</h3>
            <ul>
                <li><strong>GIRLS PLAYING ON BOYS’ TEAMS.</strong> Girls are eligible to play on boys’
                    4
                    teams with parent/guardian permission.</li>
                <li><strong>TYPES OF TEAMS.</strong> Teams with females only are Girls Teams. All others
                    are Boys Teams.</li>
            </ul>
            <h3>COACHING FROM THE SIDELINES</h3>
            <ul>
                <li>Coaching from the sidelines, i.e., giving direction to one’s own team on
                    points of strategy and position, is permitted provided that:</li>
                <ol type="1">
                    <li>No mechanical, electrical or other devices are used to amplify the
                        voice.</li>
                    <li>The tone of voice is informative and not a harangue.</li>
                    <li>The coaching takes place within the team’s bench area.</li>
                    <li>No coach, substitute, player or spectator is to make derogatory
                        remarks or gestures to the referees, linesmen, players, substitutes
                        or spectators.</li>
                    <li>No coach, player, substitute or spectator is to use profanity or
                        incite, in any manner, disruptive behavior of any kind.</li>
                </ol>
            </ul>
            <h3>GAME TERMINATION</h3>
            <ul>
                <li>Any game terminated after 15 minutes into the second half by the referee
                    by reason of the elements, or by reason of grave disorder on the part of
                    the coaches, players or spectators of a team that is losing at the point that
                    the game is terminated, shall stand as a completed game. If a team is
                    ahead and the game is called because of their actions they will lose the
                    game 1-0.</li>
            </ul>
            <h3>CONDITIONS OF REPLAY OF GAMES</h3>
            <ul>
                <li>Any game which is required to be replayed as a result of any protest or
                    appeal, shall be subject to the following conditions:
                    <ol type="1">
                        <li>The game shall be replayed on the same field, as was the
                            suspended or protested game, unless otherwise agreed by the
                            coaches.</li>
                        <li>Impartial referees shall be assigned to the new game.</li>
                        <li>The PROTEST AND APPEALS COMMITTEE shall have the power
                            to impose such additional conditions on the replay of the game, as
                            it deems appropriate under the circumstances.</li>
                    </ol>
                </li>
            </ul>

                <li>Each team must determine whether or not referees are registered prior to
                    the start of each game. Upon request, referees officiating at any game
                    must willingly and without bias, show documentation regarding their
                    certification level and registration standing with the USSF to coach,
                    assistant coach, or team captain of teams participating in that game. Prior
                    to the game a coach may decide to postpone the game if the referees do
                    not produce the requested documentation. The game is to be replayed at
                    a later date.</li>
                <li>Referees not complying with this section will be referred to the Disciplinary
                    Committee.</li>
